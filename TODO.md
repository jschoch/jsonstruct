# TODO list

figure out config and how the defaults will work
  shoudl look for a ./schema dir and then parse them out

need warnings when blasting over old config files

need to warn for unsupported types

need to be able to deal with $ref, likely will make default use file refs

should have some thoughts around patter properties, perhaps some use of maps.
